Today we will explore the following:

1.Various logical statement: if, elseif, while, do while, switch and more
2. We will get into ternery statement(shorter syntax for if else statements)

3. We will get into es6 fat arrow functions... What's the advantage of using it. 

4. Cover reduce function on array

5. We will DO more string and array algorithms

   1. Write a function that calculates factorial of a number.
   For example, fact(5) should be 5*4*3*2*1=120. First Write with for/while loop. Then write a recursive version of the function

   2. Write a function that checks if a number is prime or not. A prime number is only divisible by that number and 1 only. 

   3. Write a function that returns the last item of the array, without modifying the array. Modify this function to return first item and middle item as well. 

   4. Write a function that takes in an array of number and returns the average of the numbers. The return type should be number. (also make sure items are converted to number first)

   5. Write a function that takes in an array and returns the maximum and minimum value. The return type should be maximum_minimum. For example, [100,2,1,3,4,5] should return 100_1 . Try to do this in one loop.

   

   *** Demo the try catch exception in javascript

   If more time remaining, then cover various math functions.
